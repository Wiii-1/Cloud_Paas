# Portfolio Website - Cloud Paas Architecture

It includes a static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) deployed on Vercel, a backend service hosted on Railway, and a PostgreSQL database provisioned on Neon.tech. The infrastructure for both the frontend and backend is managed using Terraform, following the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## 🔑 Key Concepts Applied
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Utilized Vercel to host the frontend and Railway to deploy and manage the backend, eliminating the need to maintain infrastructure manually.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Used Terraform to automate the provisioning of both frontend (Vercel) and backend (Railway) environments, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.

- Static Web Hosting
Deployed the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) as static assets on Vercel, taking advantage of global CDN and optimized build pipelines.

- Backend Deployment on PaaS
Hosted a backend service (e.g., API server) on Railway, allowing for easy deployment, scaling, and monitoring of server-side logic.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
Frontend
- Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Hosted on: Vercel
- Deployed using: Terraform (Vercel provider)

Backend
- Built with: (e.g., Node.js / Express) ← (replace with your actual backend stack)
- Hosted on: Railway
- Deployed using: Terraform (Railway provider)

Database
- Type: PostgreSQL
- Hosted on: Neon.tech
- Provisioned: Manually (not via Terraform)

Infrastructure Provisioning
- Managed with: Terraform
- Providers used: Vercel, Railway
- Approach: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## 🔧 Deployment Breakdown
Frontend:
Deployed on Vercel via Terraform.
The static website (HTML/CSS/JS) is managed and deployed using Terraform scripts directly targeting Vercel's API.

Backend:
Deployed on Railway using Terraform.
The backend API service is hosted on Railway, and the deployment pipeline is defined via Terraform configuration for consistency.

Database:
Hosted on Neon.tech.
PostgreSQL database setup was done manually and is not managed by Terraform (to be integrated in future improvements).
