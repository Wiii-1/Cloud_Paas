                <h3>Cloud Paas Architecture</h3>
                <p>This project is a personal portfolio website that integrates several cutting-edge technologies, including Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Deployed on Vercel, the website uses serverless functions and a PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon.tech to allow users to submit suggestions for website improvements. The frontend is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, which automates the setup of the backend environment.</p>
                <p>The architecture consists of a simple static site that interacts with a backend API, hosted on Vercel, to handle user inputs. The backend is powered by a serverless function, providing scalability without managing physical servers. With Terraform, the project ensures that the infrastructure is deployed in a repeatable and efficient manner, highlighting the principles of modern cloud computing.</p>
