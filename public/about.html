                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Wesley Mariano, and I’m navigating the exciting, challenging, and rewarding world of Computer Science at STI College. Fueled by curiosity (and caffeine), I dive into coding, always driven by the thrill of solving problems and creating things that work.</p>
                <p>My academic journey hasn't been linear — it's been a series of twists, turns, and discoveries. Through every challenge and late-night coding session, I've learned to adapt and grow, finding my passion in technology and coding. From backend logic to exploring new technologies, I’m always learning and building, one project at a time.</p>
                <p>In this ever-evolving field, I’m continuously working to improve and push the boundaries of what I can create. Join me on this journey and take a look at my work in the Projects section to see where my passion for technology is taking me.</p>
